## About The Project

![Untitled design(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56234578/224179040-240bfe6b-0998-4b80-8e9d-489dd9ce5834.gif)


This is a fully functional web app clone of Google Keep allows users to create, edit and delete notes, as well as assign labels to them

Below are some details how this clone is made from scratch:
* Used JavaScript for client-side scripting to enable dynamic, responsive and interactive user interface
* Used NodeJS for backend to create a server platform to run the application.
* Used HTML and CSS to style the web app, including the layout, typography, and color scheme for visually-appealing user interface.
* Implemented local storage persistence for storing data on the client side, which allows the web app to work even when the user is offline.
